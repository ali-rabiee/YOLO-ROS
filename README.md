# YOLO-ROS: Object Detection and Gripper Control Integration

This ROS package integrates YOLO object detection with a robotic arm control system, utilizing Kinova gripper finger positions and head position feedback for automating grasp and release actions. The detected objects are processed and published along with segmentation masks and image annotations.

## Overview

This ROS package subscribes to the camera feed and finger position of the Kinova robotic arm and detects objects in real-time using a pre-trained YOLO model (`best.pt`). Based on object positions and head orientation feedback, the package can determine whether the gripper should automatically execute grasp or release actions. The package also publishes object detection results, bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and the positions of objects in the scene.

### Key Features
- Real-time object detection using YOLOv8.
- Automatic execution of grasp and release based on the proximity of the gripper to detected objects.
- Visualization of object bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and center dots of objects.
- Integration with the Kinova arm's finger positions and head position input.

## Requirements

The following dependencies are required to run this package:

- **ROS (Robot Operating System)**: Tested with ROS Noetic.
- **Python 3.x**
- **YOLOv8**: You can install YOLO from the [Ultralytics repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).
- **cv_bridge**: ROS package for OpenCV.
- **OpenCV**: Image processing library.
- **Kinova ROS Package**: For controlling and receiving data from the Kinova arm.

### Python Dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python ultralytics numpy
```

### ROS Dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-cv-bridge ros-noetic-image-transport
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository into your catkin workspace:

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolo-ros.git
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

2. Make sure that your pre-trained YOLO model (`best.pt`) is saved in the appropriate location.

## Node Structure

### Subscribed Topics

- `/camera/color/image_raw` (`sensor_msgs/Image`): The input camera image stream for performing object detection.
- `/j2n6s300_driver/out/finger_position` (`kinova_msgs/FingerPosition`): The current finger position of the Kinova gripper.
- `/head_position` (`std_msgs/String`): Head position input (`Left`, `Right`, `Neutral`) used for deciding grasp and release actions.

### Published Topics

- `/yolo/image_with_bboxes` (`sensor_msgs/Image`): The camera image with YOLO-predicted bounding boxes and annotations.
- `/yolo/segmentation_mask_2d` (`sensor_msgs/Image`): The segmentation mask for detected objects in `mono8` format.
- `/yolo/segmentation_mask_2d_visual` (`sensor_msgs/Image`): A visualization of the segmentation mask in `bgr8` format.
- `/yolo/image_with_center_dots` (`sensor_msgs/Image`): Image with center dots drawn at the center of detected objects.
- `/yolo/automove` (`std_msgs/String`): A command (`Grasp`, `Release`) to automatically control the gripper based on object detection.

## Usage

To run the `yolo-ros-node`, ensure the ROS environment is set up correctly and that the robot arm is properly connected. Execute the following:

```bash
roslaunch yolo_ros yolo_ros.launch
```

This will start the node that listens to the camera feed and processes the images through YOLO for object detection.

## Parameters

- `best.pt`: The pre-trained YOLOv8 model located in `/home/tnlab/catkin_ws/src/yolo-ros/best.pt`. Update this if you have your own model.
- `grasp_executed` (`/grasp_executed`): Boolean ROS parameter to prevent repeated grasp commands.
- `release_executed` (`/release_executed`): Boolean ROS parameter to prevent repeated release commands.

## Customization

### Modifying Object Classes

The following classes and their colors are defined in the node:
- Workspace: White (`(200, 200, 200)`)
- Jaco Arm: Green (`(0, 100, 0)`)
- Object: Blue (`(0, 0, 100)`)
- Bin: Red (`(100, 0, 0)`)

You can modify the `color_map` and `name_to_id` dictionaries in the code to customize the colors or add new classes.

### Adjusting Gripper Positions

If you need to adjust the criteria for triggering grasp/release actions, modify the conditions in the `image_callback` method, where the gripper position is compared to the detected object positions.
